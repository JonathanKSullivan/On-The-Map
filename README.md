# OnTheMap
An app that takes a photo, and overlay text to meme-ify your friends. Then share on your favorite social channels! 

## Purpose:
I created an app with a map that shows information posted by other Udacity students. The map  contains pins that show the location where other Udacity students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. The user will be able to add their own data by posting a string that can be reverse geocoded to a location, and a URL.

## How to use:
Open using Xcode on mac.
